# DESY-Timepix4

Research with photons provides insights into fundamental material properties and
shows how they can be controlled. Researchers examine materials and biomolecules
with extremely powerful and short pulse x-rays. Therefore, detector technology
is continually developing to meet the needs of these researchers. Timepix4 is a
versatile photon detector readout chip with 55 Î¼m pixels, recently developed by
CERN[1] on behalf of the Medipix collaboration[2]. It can operate both in a photon
counting mode with frame readout, and a timestamping mode with event readout.
Both of these modes offer higher performance than existing Medipix3[3] and
Timepix3[4] chips. Control software of Timepix4 is being developed at DESY[5]
by the Detector Science group. The aim of this report giving a brief overview
of calibration studies of Timepix4 which consists of testing chip under different
conditions, developing visualization tools, and debugging control software.

One may find details of the work in the FinalReport.pdf file.
